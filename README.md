# üèÜ AI Co-Scientist Lab Orchestrator (Hackathon Submission)

## üí° Novel Idea: Autonomous Scientific Discovery

This project implements a multi-agent system designed to automate the initial, iterative phase of scientific research: **Hypothesis Generation, Parallel Prior Art Review, and Experimental Protocol Drafting.** It simulates a **collaborative scientific team** to accelerate discovery from weeks to minutes, making complex research accessible.

The core innovation is orchestrating **multi-tool execution** over **large, unstructured data** payloads, a classic challenge in production AI.

## ‚ú® Technical Showcase (Composio Meta-Tools)

This solution is engineered to maximize technical points by forcing the use of critical Composio features in a sequential, high-stakes workflow.

| Composio Feature | Agent & Action | Why It Wins |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`COMPOSIO_CREATE_PLAN`** | **Hypothesis Agent** uses this first to decompose the research goal into auditable, sequential steps. | Guarantees reliable, structured workflow execution and control. |
| **`COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL`** | **Literature Agent** runs concurrent searches across **Arxiv** (research papers) and **PubChem** (chemical data). | Demonstrates high-speed parallel data collection from distinct, external sources. |
| **`COMPOSIO_REMOTE_WORKBENCH`** | Used immediately after multi-execute to **store the raw, large text** of scientific papers (simulated payload). | **CRITICAL:** Prevents LLM context overflow, showcasing a production-ready solution for big data. |
| **`COMPOSIO_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL`** | **Analysis Agent** executes a simulated Python/Pandas script to clean and analyze the Workbench data. | Enables the agent to perform **computation and analysis**, going beyond simple text summarization. |
